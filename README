Lurking Window Detector
-----------------------

   Do you have an experience with a not-well-written application
   that uses a dialog box to notify the completion of time-consuming
   work and opens it behind other windows?  Being distracted with
   waiting and checking such an unnoticeable window is ... not fun.
   This program detects a new window with the specified title/class
   and notifies the user about it.

Installation
------------

   To install, just put the executable somewhere.

   To uninstall,
   -  uncheck the checkbox to run on Windows startup,
